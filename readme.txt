This is the documentation text about different files in this repository.
I am only able to send the data to the MongoDB cloud plateform(ATLAS).
Because little knowledge about JS, I am influent to make a react based api.
I am only submitting the api that responsible for data sending to server(here MongoDB Atlas), i am also attahing the pymongo access link for the database.
link:- "mongodb+srv://tempdata:tempdata@tempdataset.rttjq.mongodb.net/tempdataset?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

Their are three data sets and i combined all the data set to one file using python csv module, program of which i include in the raw data folder.
and make one file two file one of includeing the pre-existing datetime in the dataset i.e. 2015 year. and one of having current time funtion, which upload the data to server once it started each datapoint every after 1 second delay as 1 minute as (which is mentioned in the documentation), if included results in the delay of whole process.

As, i have mentioned erlier that my in sufficiency of dealing with java, i am submitting assesment only with one api(datasending).

Howerver, Here i am unable to add the user authentication.
